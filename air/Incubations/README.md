## General considerations
- If you plan to do incubations at MPI-BGC, please contact Iris Kuhlmann (kuhlmann@bgc-jena.mpg.de) in advance and describe what you intend to do and the material you need. Also, please contact Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de) to inform him that you will use the extraction line located in the radiocarbon laboratory.
- Avoid plastic to store and handle material that will be analyzed for radiocarbon, as it would modify the isotopic signature.
- Label all flasks including their ID, type of material, responsible person, country and sampling date.
 
## Water holding capacity
The maximum water holding capacity (WHCmax) is the water volume that can be absorbed by 100 g of dried soil. WHCmax should be calculated since previous experiments showed that the respiration of soil microbes in many soils is highest at 60% WHCmax. 

### Considerations
- Please read the protocol summarized by Jessica Heublein to obtain WHCmax (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
- Necessary materials are at Marion Schrumpf lab (B2.018).
- Soil has to be previously sieved (see instructions in 'solids/Soils').
- Use the template to write the measures and perform the calculations (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
- The procedure is based on the protocol summarized by Jessica Heublein (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
  
### Materials

- 2 mm sieved soil.
- Small paper bags.
- 50 ml Falcon tubes with an open bottom.
- Mesh material (polyester).
- Rubber bands.
- Crystallizing dishes (2 pieces, Ø 230 mm).
- Towel paper.
- Sand.

### Procedure

1. Determine the soil water content to correct the WHCmax. For that:

   i. Label paper bags and write the net weight of the glass in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).

   ii. Weigh 10 g of sample in the bag and write the weight.
    
   iii. Dry the sample overnight (min. 24 h) at 105°C till the constant weight is adjusted.
    
   iv. Take the bags out of the oven (put on an oven mitt) and put them immediately in the desiccator cupboard for cool down (otherwise they can absorb water from the air).

   v. Weigh the dried samples and write the weight.

   vi. Calculate the dry matter content. For that use the formulas in air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx that are already programmed in the second sheet of the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).

2. Determine the soil water absorption:

   i. Close the open bottom of the Falcon tubes with mesh material and seal them with rubber bands.
   
   ii. Weigh the Falcon tubes and write the weight in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
   
   iii. Weigh 15 g of sieved soil in the Falcon tube and write the weight.
   
   iv. Put a towel in the first crystallizing dish and place the Falcon tubes in (mesh downwards).
   
   v. Fill the dish with distilled water (ratio 1:2, water height: soil height).
   
   vi. Cover the dish with a paper towel overnight.
   
   vii. The next day, fill a second crystallizing dish with sand (at least 1cm high) and put the tubes in for 30 min for draining.
   
   viii. Weigh the tubes and write the weight.
   
   ix. Calculate the WHCmax. For that use the formulas in air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx that are already programmed in the second sheet of the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
   

## Incubations

### Considerations

- Please read the protocol to perform the incubations and measure the CO<sub>2</sub> respiration using the LA-COR (Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx).
- The Li-Cor is located in Marion Schrumpf's lab (B2.018). Please book the space at https://teamup.com/ksa4ng2jmfe4wcwp3, specifying you will use the Li-Cor. Also, the flushing with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air is carried out in the same space and should be booked.
- If you have enough time it is desirable to carry out an incubation test to know the approximate time your samples need to reach the necessary CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This is to book the extraction line (radiocarbon laboratory) a priori and not submit the soil to toxic concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>.
- For the <sup>14</sup>C measurement a minimum amount of 1 mg carbon per sample is required (2% CO<sub>2</sub>=1850 ppm/bar per litre).
- If samples have been stored at low temperatures before incubation, a pre-incubation is recommended to allow soil microbes to adapt to incubation temperature. It means pre-incubating the sample for 4 days under laboratory conditions (20°C).

### Materials
- 2 mm sieved soil. 
- Dispensette for distilled water.
- Flushing gas (CO<sub>2</sub> free) from Westfalen
- Calibration jars (with identified volume [ml]).
- Silicone septa to seal the jars.
- Incubation/preserving jars. The size will depend on the amount of soil that will be incubated.
- Needles.

### Procedure
1. Estimate the required water amount to adjust the soil moisture to 60% water holding capacity. It is calculated in 'air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx'. Use distilled water for this purpose.
2. Label the incubation jars and write their weight.
3. Weigh ~100 g (it could be less depending on soil type) of sieved soil in the jar and add the estimated water amount via a spraying nozzle equally to the soil sample. 
4. To avoid changing the adjusted soil moisture, a certain amount of distilled water should be added to the bottom of the incubation jars.
5. Close the lid of the incubation jars with the septa. To make closing easier, moisten the septa with a little distilled water.
6. Flush the jars with synthetic (CO<sub>2</sub>-free) air for 3 minutes using needles and cocks to create a flux throughout the jar. When finished, use a container with water to remove the overpressure. For that, immerse the needle in the water until the bubbles no longer form.
7. Close both cocks and remove the needles. Write the date and time. This is the starting point of incubation.
8. If samples are to be incubated under constant conditions (e.g., 20°C), place them into a climate chamber.

## Measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> with Li-Cor

### Considerations
- Measures of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration should be done frequently to determine if the carbon (1 mg carbon per sample) for radiocarbon analysis has already been reached avoiding toxic concentrations that may modify the results.
- Please read the protocol to perform the incubations and measure the CO<sub>2</sub> respiration using the Li-Cor (Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx).
- Switch on the Li-Cor one hour before you want to measure.

### Materials
- CO2-analyzer (Li-Cor® 6262). Located in lab B2.018.
- Calibrating gas (3000 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> + N) from Westfalen.
- 5 ml syringe with Stopcock.
- Needles.

### Procedure
1. Adjust the CO2 baseline to zero (use the knob "COsub>2</sub> zero").
2. The pressure should be at 600 mbar. Check that the water trap is not saturated (indicator colour blue not purple) and the Soda Lime in the COsub>2</sub> trap is not older than 3 months (check the label on the tube).
3. At the beginning of each series of measurements you have to make a calibration line with a COsub>2</sub> reference gas (CO2-value = 3000 ppm). For that, add a needle to the syringe and pierce the septum of the COsub>2</sub> analyser in the middle and use volumes of reference gas of 5, 4.4, 4, 3.4, 3, 2.4, 2, 1.4, 1, and 0.4 ml.
   
   i. Adjust the setup settings:
      - Select the integrate-function: "Function" "9" and press "Enter".
      - Select the channel code for CO2 in µmol/mol abs.: "22" and press "Enter".
      - Select the starting point of your measurement: "On Exit" (integration will start immediately) or "Thrsh"  (integration starts when the selected channel rises above the threshold value). Select "Thrsh" and press "Enter".
      - Select the starting threshold value: "0.25" and press "Enter".
      - Select the ending point of your measurement: "Manual", "elaps tm" or "Thrsh". Select "Thrsh" (integration stops at the threshold value of 0.25µm/m). Do not press "Enter" yet.

    ii. Open the stopcock of the syringe. Press "Enter". Press the plunger evenly down. Measurement starts. Write the "peak area (int)" and "peak height (max)" in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_CO2_concentration.xlsx).

    iii. For further measurements (each volume of reference gas): Select integrate function: "Function" "9". Press "Enter". Press "Enter" 3 times more, open the stopcock, press "Enter" and press the plunger down. Measurement starts (To switch between displays to see the peak area and the peak height, press 1 and 2, respectively).
   
    iv. Plot the calibration curve. It is calculated in the template.

4. Measure your samples. 
   i. Wirl the incubation jar slightly, so that the developed COsub>2</sub> is uniformly distributed.
   
   ii. Connect two needles to the septa.
   
   ii. Connect the syringe (with the stopcock) to one needle in the incubation jar.
   
   iii. Take 5 ml of gas sample and close the stopcock in the incubation jar (3, ii).
   
   iv. The procedure for measurement is the same as for the calibration.
   
   v. Write the "peak area (int)" and "peak height (max)" in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_CO2_concentration.xlsx).
   
   vi. Inject 5 ml of CO<sub>2</sub>-free to compensate the pressure.
   
   vii. Close the CO<sub>2</sub> gas bottle after usage and turn off the Li-Cor.

If the concentrations correspond to a quantity of carbon greater than 1 mg, extract the air from the incubation jars directly into the extraction line (radiocarbon laboratory) or by passing the air into the flasks. Very high concentrations are toxic to bacteria and microorganisms in the soil.
  
## Extraction at the Graphitisation-Line

### Considerations
- Reserve the extraction line by writing directly to Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de), the director of the radiocarbon laboratory, specifying the number of samples you intend to extract. In general, no more than 10 samples per day are allowed.
- Please read the extraction line usage protocol (air/Protocols/Extraction_Flasks_Graph_Line.pdf) and the explanation of the logic behind the different steps (air/Protocols/Extraction_explanation_to_the_instruction.pdf) prepared by Axel Steinhof. Note that this protocol is updated periodically, so when you book the line, please ask Axel if there is a new version.
- As mentioned above, if you know how long your incubations take to reach the desired concentration, reserve the line before you start the incubations to avoid toxic conditions.
- If possible, learn how to use the extraction line with the incubation tests. A mistake will likely be made at this stage of the process and the sample will be lost, so it is best to internalize the procedure before extracting the final samples.
  
### Materials
- Extraction line. 
- Needles.
- Dry ice.
- Liquid nitrogen.
- Propanol or isopropanol.
- Dewars for putting dry ice mixed with propanol and liquid nitrogen.
- Thermometer. 

### Procedure
1. Send the input file with sample names to the radiocarbon laboratory for assigning P-Numbers and preparing the riglets.
2. Prepare the refrigerant mixture of dry ice and isopropanol in two dewars controlling that the temperature is lower than -70 °C. One dewar is to trap the water in the line and the other one to precool the jars.
3. Precool the jar.
4. Extract the gas following the steps that are well described in the protocol (air/Protocols/Extraction_Flasks_Graph_Line.pdf) and write the pressure values and data in the Extraction template (air/Templates/Extraction_control_template.pdf) prepared by Axel Steinhof.
5. Add hydrogen to each riglet following the instructions for "Postprocessing at the UGCS" in the extraction protocol (air/Protocols/Extraction_Flasks_Graph_Line.pdf).
6. Filled riglets should be left on the table outside the laboratory with the input file and the filled information to be graphitized and processed.
