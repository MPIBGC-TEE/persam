- WHCmax template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx)
- Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx)
- CO<sub>2</sub> concentration soil respiration (air/Templates/Incubations_CO2_concentration.xlsx)

## General considerations
- If you plan to do incubations at MPI-BGC, please contact Iris Kuhlmann (kuhlmann@bgc-jena.mpg.de) in advance and describe what you intend to do and the material you need. Also, please contact Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de) to inform him that you will use the extraction line located in the radiocarbon laboratory.
- Avoid plastic to store and handle material that will be analyzed for radiocarbon, as it would modify the isotopic signature.
- Label all flasks including their ID, type of material, responsible person, country and sampling date.
 
## Water holding capacity
The maximum water holding capacity (WHCmax) is the water volume that can be absorbed by 100 g of dried soil. WHCmax should be calculated since previous experiments showed that the respiration of soil microbes in many soils is highest at 60% WHCmax. 

## Considerations
- Please read the protocol summarized by Jessica Heublein to obtain WHCmax (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
- Necessary materials are at Marion Schrumpf lab (B2.018).
- Soil has to be previously sieved (see instructions in 'solids/Soils').
- Use the template to write the measures and perform the calculations (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
- The procedure is based on the protocol summarized by Jessica Heublein (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
  
### Materials

- 2 mm sieved soil.
- Small paper bags.
- 50 ml Falcon tubes with an open bottom.
- Mesh material (polyester).
- Rubber bands.
- Crystallizing dishes (2 pieces, Ø 230 mm).
- Towel paper.
- Sand.

### Procedure

1. Determine the soil water content to correct the WHCmax. For that:

   i. Label paper bags and write the net weight of the glass in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).

   ii. Weigh 10 g of sample in the bag and write the weight.
    
   iii. Dry the sample overnight (min. 24 h) at 105°C till the constant weight is adjusted.
    
   iv. Take the bags out of the oven (put on an oven mitt) and put them immediately in the desiccator cupboard for cool down (otherwise they can absorb water from the air).

   v. Weigh the dried samples and write the weight.

   vi. Calculate the dry matter content. For that use the formulas in air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx that are already programmed in the second sheet of the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).

2. Determine the soil water absorption:

   i. Close the open bottom of the Falcon tubes with mesh material and seal them with rubber bands.
   
   ii. Weigh the Falcon tubes and write the weight in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
   
   iii. Weigh 15 g of sieved soil in the Falcon tube and write the weight.
   
   iv. Put a towel in the first crystallizing dish and place the Falcon tubes in (mesh downwards).
   
   v. Fill the dish with distilled water (ratio 1:2, water height: soil height).
   
   vi. Cover the dish with a paper towel overnight.
   
   vii. The next day, fill a second crystallizing dish with sand (at least 1cm high) and put the tubes in for 30 min for draining.
   
   viii. Weigh the tubes and write the weight.
   
   ix. Calculate the WHCmax. For that use the formulas in air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx that are already programmed in the second sheet of the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
   

## Incubations

## Considerations

- Please read the protocol to perform the incubations and measure the CO<sub>2</sub> respiration using the LA-COR (Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx).
- The Li-Cor is located in Marion Schrumpf's lab (B2.018). Please book the space at https://teamup.com/ksa4ng2jmfe4wcwp3, specifying you will use the Li-Cor. Also, the flushing with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air is carried out in the same space and should be booked.
- If you have enough time it is desirable to carry out an incubation test to know the approximate time your samples need to reach the necessary CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This is to book the extraction line (radiocarbon laboratory) a priori and not submit the soil to toxic concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>.
- For the <sup>14</sup>C measurement a minimum amount of 1 mg carbon per sample is required (2% CO<sub>2</sub>=1850 ppm/bar per litre).
- If samples have been stored at low temperatures before incubation, a pre-incubation is recommended to allow soil microbes to adapt to incubation temperature. It means pre-incubating the sample for 4 days under laboratory conditions (20°C).

### Materials
- 2 mm sieved soil. 
- Dispensette for distilled water.
- Flushing gas (CO2 free) from Westfalen
- Calibration jars (with identified volume [ml]).
- Silicone septa to seal the jars.
- Incubation/preserving jars. The size will depend on the amount of soil that will be incubated.

### Procedure
1. Estimate the required water amount to adjust the soil moisture to 60% water holding capacity. It is calculated in 'air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx'. Use distilled water for this purpose.
2. Label the incubation jars and write their weight.
3. Weigh ~100 g (it could be less depending on soil type) of sieved soil in the jar and add the estimated water amount via a spraying nozzle equally to the soil sample. 
4. To avoid changing the adjusted soil moisture, a certain amount of distilled water should be added to the bottom of the incubation jars.
5. Close the lid of the incubation jars with the septa. To make closing easier, moisten the septa with a little distilled water.
6. Flush the jars with synthetic (CO<sub>2</sub>-free) air for 3 minutes using needles and cocks to create a flux throughout the jar. When finished, use a container with water to remove the overpressure. For that, immerse the needle in the water until the bubbles no longer form.
7. Close both cocks and remove the needles. Write the date and time. This is the starting point of incubation.
8. If samples are to be incubated under constant conditions (e.g., 20°C), place them into a climate chamber.

## Measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> with Li-Cor

## Considerations
- Please read the protocol to perform the incubations and measure the CO<sub>2</sub> respiration using the LA-COR (Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx).
- Switch on the Li-Cor one hour before you want to measure.

### Materials
- CO2-analyzer (Li-Cor® 6262). Located in lab B2.018.
- Calibrating gas (3000 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> + N) from Westfalen.
- 5 ml syringe with Stopcock.
- Needles.

### Procedure

## Extraction line

## Considerations
- Book the extraction line directly by writing to Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de) specifying the number of samples you will extract. In general, no more than 10 samples per day are allowed.
- As mentioned before, if you know when your incubations need to reach the desired concentration, book the line before starting the incubations to avoid toxic conditions.
