# Gas sampling from incubations of soils and other solid material

## Useful files
- WHCmax protocol (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
- WHCmax template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx)
- Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx)

## General considerations
- If you plan to do incubations at MPI-BGC, please contact Iris Kuhlmann (kuhlmann@bgc-jena.mpg.de) in advance and describe what you intend to do and the material you need. Also, please contact Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de) to inform him that you will use the extraction line located in the radiocarbon laboratory.
- Avoid plastic to store and handle material that will be analyzed for radiocarbon, as it would modify the isotopic signature.
- Label all flasks including their ID, type of material, responsible person, country and sampling date.
 
## Water holding capacity
The maximum water holding capacity (WHCmax) is the water volume that can be absorbed by 100 g of dried soil. WHCmax should be calculated since previous experiments showed that the respiration of soil microbes in many soils is highest at 60% WHCmax. 

## Considerations
- Please read the protocol summarized by Jessica Heublein to obtain WHCmax (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
- Necessary materials are at Marion Schrumpf lab (B2.018).
- Soil has to be previously sieved (see instructions in 'solids/Soils').
- Use the template to write the measures and perform the calculations (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
- The procedure is based on the protocol summarized by Jessica Heublein (air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx).
  
### Materials

- 2 mm sieved soil.
- Small paper bags.
- 50 ml Falcon tubes with an open bottom.
- Mesh material (polyester).
- Rubber bands.
- Crystallizing dishes (2 pieces, Ø 230 mm).
- Towel paper.
- Sand.

### Procedure

1. Determine the soil water content to correct the WHCmax. For that:

   i. Label paper bags and write the net weight of the glass in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).

   ii. Weigh 10 g of sample in the bag and write the weight.
    
   iii. Dry the sample overnight (min. 24 h) at 105°C till the constant weight is adjusted.
    
   iv. Take the bags out of the oven (put on an oven mitt) and put them immediately in the desiccator cupboard for cool down (otherwise they can absorb water from the air).

   v. Weigh the dried samples and write the weight.

   vi. Calculate the dry matter content. For that use the formulas in air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx that are already programmed in the second sheet of the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).

2. Determine the soil water absorption:

   i. Close the open bottom of the Falcon tubes with mesh material and seal them with rubber bands.
   
   ii. Weigh the Falcon tubes and write the weight in the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
   
   iii. Weigh 15 g of sieved soil in the Falcon tube and write the weight.
   
   iv. Put a towel in the first crystallizing dish and place the Falcon tubes in (mesh downwards).
   
   v. Fill the dish with distilled water (ratio 1:2, water height: soil height).
   
   vi. Cover the dish with a paper towel overnight.
   
   vii. The next day, fill a second crystallizing dish with sand (at least 1cm high) and put the tubes in for 30 min for draining.
   
   viii. Weigh the tubes and write the weight.
   
   ix. Calculate the WHCmax. For that use the formulas in air/Procotols/Incubations_WHCmax.docx that are already programmed in the second sheet of the template (air/Templates/Incubations_Water_holding_capacity.xlsx).
   

## Incubations

## Considerations

- Please read the protocol to perform the incubations and measure the CO<sub>2</sub> respiration using the LA-COR (Incubations and measure of soil respiration (air/Protocols/Incubations_and_measuring_soil_respiration.docx).
- The LI-COR is located in Marion Schrumpf's lab (B2.018). Please book the space at https://teamup.com/ksa4ng2jmfe4wcwp3, specifying you will use the LI-COR.
- If you have enough time it is desirable to carry out an incubation test to know the approximate time your samples need to reach the necessary CO2 concentration. This is to book the extraction line (radiocarbon laboratory) a priori and not submit the soil to toxic concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>.

## Extraction line

## Considerations
- Book the extraction line directly by writing to Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de) specifying the number of samples you will extract. In general, no more than 10 samples per day are allowed.
- As mentioned before, if you know when your incubations need to reach the desired concentration, book the line before starting the incubations to avoid toxic conditions.
