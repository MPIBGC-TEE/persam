# Gas sampling from incubations of soils and other solid material

## General considerations
- If you plan to do incubations at MPI-BGC, please contact Iris Kuhlmann (kuhlmann@bgc-jena.mpg.de) in advance and describe what you intend to do and the material you need. Besides, contact Axel Steinhof (steinhof@bgc-jena.mpg.de) informing you will use the extraction line located at the Radiocarbon laboratory.
- Avoid plastic to store and handle material that will be analyzed for radiocarbon, as it would modify the isotopic signature.
- Label all flasks including their ID, type of material, responsible person, country and sampling date.
