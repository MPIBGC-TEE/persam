- Amount of samples
- Amount of material per sample.
- Materials: bags, labels, soil auger, palette knife

* Sieving the soil down to 2mm: Removing roots and stones, weighing, refilling and cleaning. Depending on the total sample volume, soil layer and soil structure, this should take no more than one hour per sample, assuming you bring 500 mg of soil sample. 
* Grinding: plant material 2-4 minutes grinding and soil material 3-8 minutes grinding (depending on soil type) plus cleaning and preparation time. Add approximately 5 minutes per sample.
* Weighing: It doesn't matter if you are weighing samples for 15N or 13C or total CN app. 5-8 minutes per sample, taking into account all pre-preparation. 
For 14C we only prepare the sample list, we don't have to prepare anything else.
* Measurements: for the soil samples we should know the C/N content because this defines how much we have to weigh for the Isotopes. The plant samples are more or less similar.    
Booking procedure: 
* sieving: Greenhouse 
* grinding: only single space, 
* Weighing: weighing room, balance type XPR2 or MX5 for Isotopes and XPR205 for total CN. We should try to start with the total CN content. The ROma department needs a bit time to determine the samples. They should know in advance so that they are prepared to measure your samples immediately.

# Soil preparations for radiocarbon analyses

## General considerations

- If you plan to prepare the solid samples at MPI-BGC, please contact Iris Kuhlmann (kuhlmann@bgc-jena.mpg.de) in advance and describe what you intend to do and the material you need.
- Avoid plastic to store and handle material that will be analyzed for radiocarbon, as it would modify the isotopic signature.
- Read the "Guideline for Sampling and Preparation" prepared by Iris Kuhlmann & Jessica Heublein (Solids/Protocols/Guideline_solid_preparation.pdf)
- Label all samples including their ID, type of material, responsible person, country and sampling date.
  
## Drying
If your analyses do not involve the field conditions, dry the soil at 40&deg;. It will facilitate the sieving and avoid the decomposition of the material. 

## Sieving 

## Considerations
Soils should be sieved with a 2mm sieve for both radiocarbon analyses and incubations. 

At MPI-BGC, sieving is carried out in the greenhouse and the space has to be booked in advance at this link: https://teamup.com/ksa4ng2jmfe4wcwp37

Use gloves at all times and wash them before starting the soil manipulation.

Time: the required time will depend on the soil type and amount. As a reference consider 20-40 min per sample. 

### Materials
- 2 mm sieves.
- Tweezers.
- Isopropanol.
- Weighing paper or some material that can be used as a funnel (do not use plastic).
- Plastic bags (for material that will not analyzed).
- Glass jars to keep the sieving soils. 

### Procedure

1. Clean all material (sieve parts and tweezers) with water and distilled water, then, dry it with compressed air. Do not use paper because it can modify the isotopic signature.
2. Wripe all material with isopropanol (do NOT use ethanol) when starting and before moving on to samples of a different profile.
3. Write down the weights of the sample + the bag or container where it is stored, the glass jar and the plastic bag for stones (see the template in Templates/Soil_Sieving.xlsx).
4. Sieve the soil with the 2mm sieve, removing stones and roots. If there are samples of the same profile, go from the deepest to the most shallow, trying to go from the sample with the lowest carbon content to the one with the highest, avoiding contamination.
5. Remove roots that crossed the sieve with the tweezers. Store roots in an independent jar if you are interested in their radiocarbon. 
6. Put the sieved samples in their respective jars using the weighing paper as a funnel.
7. Write down the weights of the jars + material, plastic bag + stones and the empty bag or container where the soil was previously stored.
8. Repeat from 1 for each sample.

## Grinding 

### Considerations

Sieved soils should be ground before weighing (not for incubations). 

At MPI-BGC, grinding is carried out in the grinding room (​B1.008) and the space must be booked in advance at this link: https://teamup.com/ksa4ng2jmfe4wcwp37. Consider that only one person can work at a time, so it should be reserved with enough time, especially if you have a large number of samples. 

Read the grinding instructions written by Iris Kuhlmann & Jessica Heublein (Solids/Protocols/Grinding_instructions.pdf)

Use gloves at all times and wash them before starting the soil manipulation. Avoid the contact of isopropanol with your skin. 

Time: the required time will depend on the soil type and amount. As a reference consider 10-20 min per sample. 

### Materials

- Ball mill machine.
- Balls and grinding jars.
- Isopropanol.
- Weighing paper or some material that can be used as a funnel (do not use plastic).
- Glass jars to keep the ground soil. 

### Procedure

1. Select the grinding jar size and balls you need according to the amount of the sample. With small grinding jars, you will achieve satisfactory grinding results much faster.
2. Clean all material (grinding jars and balls) with water, distilled water and isopropanol (do Not use ethanol) at the beginning of each set of samples. Then, dry it with compressed air. Do not use paper because it can modify the isotopic signature. The number of samples you can grind at one time will depend on the number of size grinding jars you need.
3. Put the samples into the grinding jar and grind them in the ball mill. Start with 1 minute (25 rpm) and increase the time if necessary to achieve a homogeneous material. Note that during the grinding process, the sample material will heat up which may cause carbon losses. Just grind as long as necessary! Silicate enriched soils have to be ground a bit longer but with less material (max. 8 min).
4. Put the ground samples in the glass jars.
5. Clean all materials to continue with the next set of samples.

## Weighing

### Considerations
Soil samples have to be weighted to determine the C/N content.

At MPI-BGC, weighing is carried out in the weighing room (B1.010) and the space must be booked in advance at this link: https://teamup.com/ksa4ng2jmfe4wcwp37. For soil weighting, you should book the microbalance XPR205. Only those who have received instruction on the analytical balance may work with it! Instruction by Iris Kuhlmann, Ines Hilke or Heike Geilmann

Weighing is done according to soil depth (proxy of carbon content). 0-20 cm: 250 mg, 20-30 cm: 300 mg. Accuracy: 5 mg.

If you are unsure of the absence of inorganic carbon, weigh samples to determine inorganic carbon content in addition to total carbon.

Please read the weighing instructions (Solids/Protocols/Weighing_CN_analysis.pdf)

### Materials
- Ground soils.
- Ceramic pots.
- Sample boxes.
- Tungsten.
- Tweezers and spoons.
- Isopropanol.

### Procedure total carbon 

1. Use the template available on the computer connected to the microbalance.
2. Weigh in ceramic pots and place the pot in the box according to the position corresponding to the template (A,B,C..., 1,2,3...).
3. Add 400-500 mg of tungsten to each ceramic pot with the sample. Do not write down the weight.
4. Send the filled templated file to Probenannahme_RoMA@bgc-jena.mpg.de.

### Procedure inorganic carbon

1. Use the template available on the computer connected to the microbalance.
2. Weigh in ceramic pots and place the pot in the box according to the position corresponding to the template (A,B,C..., 1,2,3...).
3. Additionally weigh 1x standard soil.
4. Place in muffle furnace for 16 h at 450 °C (place in metal racks one after the other).
5. Add 400-500 mg of tungsten to each ceramic pot with the sample. Do not write down the weight.
